### 16. Implementation Readiness
Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)

### 17. Critical Failures
[✗ FAIL] No design direction chosen

## Failed Items
1.  **No design direction chosen:** The `ux-design-specification.md` does not specify which of the 6 design directions from `ux-design-directions.html` was selected. This is a critical ambiguity for implementation.
2.  **No reasoning for design direction:** The user's reasoning for their choice is not documented.
3.  **No accessibility testing strategy:** The document specifies accessibility standards but doesn't outline how they will be tested.
4.  **No rationale for color theme:** The chosen color theme is not explicitly named and the rationale is missing.

## Recommendations
1.  **Must Fix:** Please specify which of the 6 design directions from `ux-design-directions.html` should be used for the application and document the reasoning for this choice in the `ux-design-specification.md`. This is the most critical issue.
2.  **Should Improve:** Add a section to the `ux-design-specification.md` detailing the accessibility testing strategy (e.g., tools to be used, manual testing procedures).
3.  **Consider:** Add a short note explaining why the final color theme was chosen over the other options.
