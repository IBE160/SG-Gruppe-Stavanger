## Epics

### Epic 1: User Authentication & Profile Management
*   As a user, I want to securely register and log in so that I can access my personalized inventory and recipes.
*   As a user, I want to manage my profile information (e.g., email, password) so that I can keep my account up-to-date.
*   As a user, I want to stay logged in for an extended period (30+ days), so I don't have to re-enter my credentials frequently, especially on mobile.

### Epic 2: Inventory Management
*   As a user, I want to add, edit, and delete food items from my inventory so that I can accurately track what I have.
*   As a user, I want to view an overview of my pantry and fridge so that I know what ingredients are available.
*   As a user, I want to receive notifications for expiring food items so that I can use them before they go bad.
*   As a user, I want to be prompted for confirmation before my inventory is updated after cooking a meal, so I can prevent accidental deductions.
*   As a user, I want the system to recommend recipes that use ingredients close to their expiration date, so I can reduce food waste.

### Epic 3: Recipe Discovery & Meal Planning
*   As a user, I want to browse and search for recipes based on available ingredients so that I can find meal ideas easily.
*   As a user, I want to get recipe suggestions even if I'm missing a few ingredients so that I'm not limited by my current inventory.
*   As a user, I want to generate a grocery list for a selected recipe, excluding items I already own, so that I can efficiently shop for missing ingredients.
*   As a user, I want the ingredient search to be flexible and match variations (e.g., "tomato" and "tomatoes"), so I can find ingredients more easily.

### Epic 4: Offline Functionality & Data Sync
*   As a user, I want to access my inventory and recipes even without an internet connection so that I can use the app anywhere.
*   As a user, I want to see when my data was last synced so that I can trust the information displayed.

### Epic 5: User Onboarding & Guidance
*   As a new user, I want to clear guidance on how to get started so that I can quickly understand the app's core functionality.
*   As a user, I want to see helpful empty states so that I'm never confused about what to do next.

### Epic 6: System Feedback & Usability
*   As a user, I want to see clear loading indicators and receive helpful error messages with a retry option if something goes wrong, so I understand what the system is doing and can recover from problems.
