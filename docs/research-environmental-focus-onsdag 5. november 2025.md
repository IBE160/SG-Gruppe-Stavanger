# Research - Environmental Focus for Smart Food & Recipe Platform - onsdag 5. november 2025

This document summarizes the research conducted on enhancing the environmental focus of the "Smart Food & Recipe Platform" to identify unique and standout features.

---

## Key Findings from Competitive Analysis (from `reseach-missing-user-flows.md` and web searches):

*   Existing household food management apps (e.g., Nosh, NoWaste) primarily reduce environmental impact indirectly through waste reduction.
*   Some apps (like Nosh) track and report CO2 emissions saved, but the visualization and engagement around this are often basic.
*   The "Environmental Impact Focus" was identified as a unique differentiator for the "Smart Food & Recipe Platform."

## Creative Data Visualization Ideas for Environmental Impact (from web search):

The research yielded several creative concepts for visualizing environmental impact beyond simple charts:

1.  **The "Waste Footprint" Landscape/Ecosystem:** Dynamic, interactive 3D visualization of food waste types and their associated environmental impact (CO2, water, land use).
2.  **The "Resource Drain" River System/Flow Diagram:** Sankey-style diagram showing resource flow into the food system, with waste depicted as "leaks" or "diversions."
3.  **The "Decomposition Clock" with Impact Rings:** Circular visualization showing the escalating environmental impact of food items over time if wasted.
4.  **Interactive "Food Waste Ecosystem" Globe:** Global map highlighting regions with high food waste and depicting environmental consequences.
5.  **The "Global Hunger & Waste Paradox" Map:** Interactive world map simultaneously displaying food waste and food insecurity.

## Synthesized Recommendations for Unique Environmental Features:

Based on the competitive analysis and creative visualization ideas, here are actionable recommendations to enhance the environmental focus and make the app stand out:

### 1. Gamified Environmental Impact Score

*   **Concept:** Create a holistic "Eco-Score" that combines CO2, water, and land use savings, going beyond simple metrics.
*   **Visualization:** Incorporate elements of the "Decomposition Clock" to show the potential impact of individual items if wasted.
*   **Engagement:** Award users badges and achievements for reaching Eco-Score milestones (e.g., "Tree Saver," "Water Guardian").

### 2. Interactive "My Impact" Dashboard

*   **Concept:** Implement a simplified, interactive version of the "Waste Footprint" ecosystem or "Resource Drain" flow diagram as the main dashboard.
*   **Visualization:** Users can see their personal "waste landscape" or "resource river" and how it changes as they reduce waste.
*   **Engagement:** Include "Impact Equivalents" (e.g., "This week, you saved enough water to fill 3 bathtubs" or "You avoided the CO2 emissions of driving 10 miles") to make the impact tangible.

### 3. "Pledge & Progress" Feature

*   **Concept:** Allow users to set personal, measurable goals for reducing food waste (e.g., "I pledge to reduce my vegetable waste by 50% this month").
*   **Engagement:** Track progress towards goals, provide encouragement, and celebrate achievements.

### 4. Educational Content: Eco-Facts & Food Stories

*   **Concept:** A content feed with engaging, bite-sized educational content about food waste and environmental impact.
*   **Content:** Topics include environmental footprint of different foods, global impact of food waste (using infographics), and tips for sustainable practices.
*   **Personalization:** Content can be personalized based on user's waste habits (e.g., if a user wastes bread, show a fact about bread's water footprint).
*   **Sharing:** Content is shareable to social media to raise awareness.

### 5. Upcycle Your Scraps

*   **Concept:** Provide creative and practical tips for what to do with food that is no longer edible or with food scraps.
*   **Functionality:** When a user marks an item as "wasted," the app presents an "Upcycle" option with a specific tip based on the food item (e.g., planting tomato seeds, using coffee grounds for gardening, making vegetable broth from scraps).
*   **Engagement:** Transforms the negative experience of wasting food into a positive, educational, and actionable moment. Includes general composting guides.
