**Session Date:** 2025-11-06
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** BIP

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** New user onboarding and profile setup

**Session Goals:** Identify gaps, edge cases, and deviations from the main flow.

**Techniques Used:** Assumption Reversal, Role Playing

**Total Ideas Generated:** 5

### Key Themes Identified:

- **Graceful Failure:** Designing helpful recovery paths for when things go wrong.
- **Respecting User Intent & Pacing:** Giving users control over their own onboarding journey.

## Technique Sessions

- **Assumption Reversal:** Used to challenge the assumption that the registration process would be easy, revealing potential failure points like slow emails, duplicate accounts, and expired links.
- **Role Playing:** Used the persona of an 'impatient skeptic' to challenge the mandatory setup flow, revealing the need for a skip option.

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities

_Ideas ready to implement now_

- A 'Resend Link' button for when verification emails are slow.
- A helpful redirect to 'Forgot Password' if a user's email already exists.
- A smart recovery page for expired links that pre-fills the user's email.
- A 'Skip for Now' button on the initial profile setup screen.
- A dismissible banner to remind users to complete the setup if they skipped it.

### Insights and Learnings

_Key realizations from the session_

- A great user flow must anticipate and gracefully handle failure, not just plan for the "happy path."
- Onboarding should empower users by giving them control over the pacing of their own setup journey, which builds trust and reduces abandonment.

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Implement Enhanced Onboarding Flow

- Rationale: The five identified requirements are critical for a smooth, resilient, and user-respecting onboarding experience.
- Next steps: 1. Update the 'User Flows' section of `proposal.md`. 2. Convert each requirement into a specific user story or development task. 3. Brief the UI/UX designer on the new requirements for mockups.
- Resources needed: Project Manager, Developer, UI/UX Designer.
- Timeline: To be scheduled in the upcoming sprint, as this is MVP-critical.
