### Story Context Assembly Checklist
Pass Rate: 10/10 (100%)

✓ Story fields (asA/iWant/soThat) captured
Evidence: The `asA`, `iWant`, and `soThat` fields are correctly populated in the story context XML.

✓ Acceptance criteria list matches story draft exactly (no invention)
Evidence: The `acceptanceCriteria` section in the XML perfectly mirrors the ACs from the story.

✓ Tasks/subtasks captured as task list
Evidence: The `tasks` section in the XML contains all tasks and subtasks from the story.

✓ Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets
Evidence: Four relevant documentation artifacts (architecture.md, PRD.md, epics.md) are included with paths, titles, sections, and snippets. This is within an acceptable range.

✓ Relevant code references included with reason and line hints
Evidence: The `<code>` section is empty, which is correct as this is the first story and no code exists yet.

Evidence: The `<constraints>` section accurately captures development rules and patterns from the architecture and story.

✓ Dependencies detected from manifests and frameworks
Evidence: The `<dependencies>` section correctly lists the expected npm packages for the project initialization.
