## 1. Epic 2 Review: What Went Well & What Didn't

### Team Participants:
- Bob (Scrum Master)
- Alice (Product Owner)
- Charlie (Senior Dev)
- Dana (QA Engineer)
- Elena (Junior Dev)
- BIP (Project Lead)

### What Went Well (Planning & Preparation Phase):

- **Strong Planning Artifacts:** Clear user stories, acceptance criteria, and tasks were consistently defined across all Epic 2 stories, providing a solid foundation.
- **Consistent Architectural Application:** Reliable use of RESTful APIs, Supabase RLS, and Next.js Route Handlers was established in the planning, ensuring scalability and security.
- **Integrated UX:** UX requirements (e.g., `shadcn/ui` for modals, color-coded expiration borders) were successfully incorporated into acceptance criteria from the planning phase.
- **Valuable Story Context Separation:** The distinction between Story Context and technical specifications proved valuable for validation and clarity, especially for individual story planning.

### Challenges / Areas for Improvement (Planning & Preparation Phase):

- **Validation Process Inefficiencies:** Potential for redundant cross-referencing of external documentation (e.g., PRD, architecture.md) and manual effort in creating detailed test plans. This led to some double-checking and inference, potentially increasing planning effort.
- **Absence of Early Code Scaffolding:** Lack of initial code stubs in story context creation meant developers had to infer more from architectural documents rather than starting with direct code examples.
- **Streamlining Epic Selection:** The process for identifying the current epic for retrospective could be more automated and less ambiguous, reducing manual back-and-forth.
- **Consistent Focus on High-Value Stories:** A need to ensure all planning and validation efforts are always directed towards the most critical, high-value items, preventing getting bogged down in less impactful work.

### Key Insights & Learnings:

- **Enhanced Planning Artifacts are Crucial:** Generating code stubs and improved initial test plans during the `create-story-context` workflow will significantly boost developer efficiency and improve validation, especially for complex AI and API integrations.
- **Systemic Validation Improvements are Essential:** Optimizing our validation processes will prevent technical loops and ensure our efforts are focused on high-value work.
- **Clear Mandate for Process Refinement:** BIP's input provided a strong directive for targeted improvements in our planning and artifact generation for Epic 3.

## 2. Next Epic (Epic 3) Preparation Discussion

### Next Epic:
- **Number:** 3
- **Title:** Recipe Discovery & Browsing
- **Objectives:** Focuses on the user's ability to proactively search, browse, and view recipes from the external Spoonacular API.
- **Key Technical Challenges:** Spoonacular API integration complexity, caching, rate limits, Next.js Server Components.

### Preparation Strategy (BIP Approved):

- Prioritize technical reality over immediate stakeholder pressure.
- Complete 20 hours of critical technical preparation before Epic 3 officially kicks off.
- The remaining 24 hours of prep work will run concurrently with the development of Stories 3.1 and 3.2.

### Detailed Preparation Plan:

**CRITICAL PATH ITEMS (To be completed before Epic 3 kickoff - Total Estimated Effort: 20 hours):**

1.  **Spoonacular API Deep Dive & Contract Definition**
    *   Owner: Elena (Junior Dev)
    *   Estimated: 8 hours
    *   Description: Thoroughly understand Spoonacular API capabilities, limitations, rate limits, and data structures.

2.  **Automated Test Stubbing for External APIs**
    *   Owner: Dana (QA Engineer)
    *   Estimated: 12 hours
    *   Description: Research and recommend a strategy for mocking/stubbing external APIs for integration tests.

**PARALLEL PREPARATION ITEMS (Can happen during early Epic 3 stories - Total Estimated Effort: 24 hours):**

3.  **Caching Strategy Proof-of-Concept**
    *   Owner: Charlie (Senior Dev)
    *   Estimated: 16 hours
    *   Description: Explore caching mechanisms for Spoonacular API responses to ensure performance and mitigate rate limits.

4.  **Next.js Server Component Integration Patterns spike**
    *   Owner: Elena (Junior Dev)
    *   Estimated: 8 hours
    *   Description: Focused spike on best practices for integrating external APIs with Next.js Server Components and Server Actions.

## 4. Readiness Assessment & Final Reflections

### EPIC 2 READINESS ASSESSMENT (for planning artifacts):

- **Testing & Quality:** Thoroughly validated and passed (planning quality).
- **Deployment:** Not applicable (still in planning phase).
- **Stakeholder Acceptance:** Not applicable (still in planning phase).
- **Technical Health:** Robust and ready for development (planning quality).
- **Unresolved Blockers:** None from the planning phase.

### Overall Assessment:
Epic 2 planning artifacts are thoroughly validated and ready for development. The technical preparation plan for Epic 3 is clear, and the team is ready to proceed with Epic 2 development and commence Epic 3 planning immediately after the critical prep work is completed.
