# Smart Food & Recipe Platform – Reduce Food Waste, Inspire Cooking

## Background
Households waste significant amounts of food due to poor inventory tracking and lack of meal inspiration. People often forget what ingredients they have, leading to expired food and unnecessary purchases. Additionally, finding recipes that match available ingredients is time-consuming and fragmented across multiple platforms.

## Purpose
Develop a **mobile-responsive web application** that helps users **reduce food waste** and **discover meal inspiration** by intelligently managing their kitchen inventory. Users can register food items (with expiration dates), receive alerts when items are nearing expiration, and get **personalized recipe suggestions** using available ingredients and dietary preferences.

## Target Users
- **Primary:** Busy individuals and families who want to reduce waste and plan meals efficiently.  
- **Secondary:** Students and young professionals on tight budgets who want to maximize grocery use.  
- **Tertiary:** Environmentally conscious consumers interested in sustainable cooking practices.

## Core Functionality

### Must Have (MVP)
- **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login using NextAuth.js (email/password).
- **Food Inventory Management:** Users add food items with quantities and expiration dates.
  - **Barcode Scanning:** Use the device camera to scan barcodes and instantly add items, minimizing manual entry.
- **Inventory Overview:** Users can view, edit, and delete items from their pantry or fridge.
- **Smart Grocery List Generation:** Automatically creates a shopping list for a recipe or meal plan, excluding items already in the user's pantry.
- **Recipe Database (Spoonacular API):** Browse, search, and view recipes from Spoonacular’s API.
- **Flexible Recipe Matching:** Intelligently suggest recipes even if the user is missing 1-2 ingredients to prevent "no results" dead ends.
- **Manual Inventory Update:** Require user confirmation before deducting ingredients from the pantry after a meal is cooked to ensure accuracy and build trust.
- **Expiration Alerts:** In-app notifications for food nearing expiration (2–3 days before).
- **Recipe Recommendations for Expiring Items:** Suggest meals using ingredients close to expiration.

### Nice to Have (Phase 2 and Beyond)
- **User Preferences & Dietary Profiles:** Save dietary restrictions and preferred cuisines.  
- **Recipe Tagging & Advanced Filters:** Filter recipes by nutrition, difficulty, or dietary type.  
- **Creative Mode – Ingredient Substitution:** Simple AI-powered substitutions using GPT for common ingredient swaps.  
- **AI-Enhanced Search:** Use embeddings for smarter, semantic recipe matching (e.g., “healthy chicken” finds similar dishes).  
- **Smart Shopping Suggestions:** Recommend items based on cooking history and consumption patterns.  
- **Nutritional Analysis:** Display nutrition facts and healthier recipe alternatives.

**Future expansion (Phase 2–3):**
- **Smart substitution suggestions:** e.g., “You’re missing basil — try parsley instead.”  
- **Regenerate with constraints:** e.g., “Make it cheaper / faster / healthier.”

## Technical Framework

### Frontend
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router, Server Components, SSR, and SSG).  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components for modern, accessible UI.  
- **Performance:** Built-in image optimization, automatic code-splitting, and fast page loads.

### Backend
- **Architecture:** Next.js API Routes for server logic.  
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL).  
- **ORM:** Prisma for schema management and migrations.  
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js (email/password).  
- **Hosting:** Vercel (frontend + API), Supabase cloud (database).  

### Rationale
This stack ensures tight integration, rapid development, scalability, and AI-friendly API extensions while aligning with project constraints and the teacher’s feedback.

## AI Integration
- **Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**
  - **Ingredient Substitution:** GPT-powered simple substitution recommendations (e.g., lime ↔ lemon).  
  - **AI Recipe Suggestions:** Use GPT or OpenAI embeddings for creative recipe variations.  
  - **Semantic Search:** Implement OpenAI’s `text-embedding-3-small` model to improve recipe search relevance.  

AI is intentionally **not part of the MVP** to keep the core development focused and achievable within the 6-week timeline.

## Recipe Source
- **Primary:** Spoonacular API (Free tier, 150 requests/day)  
- **Fallback:** Locally stored seed dataset (20–30 curated recipes) for offline testing.

## Notifications
- **MVP:** In-app notifications when items approach expiration.  
- **Phase 2:** Add optional email alerts via Supabase functions or third-party API (Resend/SendGrid).  
- **Phase 3 (Optional):** Push notifications through web browser API.

## 9-Week Timeline

| **Week** | **Focus** |
|-----------|------------|
| **Week 1** | Project setup, authentication (NextAuth.js), Supabase connection, Prisma schema. |

| Ingredient name variations | Medium | Use normalization + fuzzy matching for common terms | High |
| Limited AI scope | Medium | Add simple GPT-based substitutions in Phase 2 | Medium |
| Data privacy | Medium | Ensure secure auth (NextAuth + Supabase), enable user data deletion | High |
| Performance optimization | Low | Use SSR and incremental static regeneration | Medium |

## Accessibility & Data Privacy
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance goals; focus on keyboard navigation and ARIA labels.  
- **Data Privacy:** Follow GDPR-like principles—users can delete accounts and data anytime.

## Deployment Strategy
- **CI/CD:** Vercel Git integration with automatic preview deployments.  
- **Database:** Supabase-hosted PostgreSQL with Prisma migrations.  
- **Environment Management:** Separate dev and production environments.  
- **Monitoring:** Supabase logs + Vercel analytics.

## Final Notes
This proposal has been updated based on a comprehensive market and technical research phase. The initial 6-week timeline and feature set have been revised to address critical findings and de-risk the project launch.

The key changes are:
- **Addition of Barcode Scanning:** Market research revealed this is a table-stakes feature for user convenience, and its absence was identified as a primary cause of user abandonment in competing apps.
- **Focus on Flexible Matching:** The high growth rate of AI-driven planners confirms that an intelligent matching algorithm is key to competitiveness.
- **Timeline Extension to 9 Weeks:** This data-driven decision was made to accommodate these critical features, ensuring the MVP is not only functional but also competitive and user-friendly at launch.

This revised approach ensures a **focused, market-aware MVP** that’s achievable within the 9-week window while laying a strong foundation for AI-powered extensions and personalization in later phases.
